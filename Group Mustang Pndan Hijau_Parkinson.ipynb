It is crucial to handle multicollinearity since it can negatively impact the performance of the regression model. Consider eliminating one of the highly correlated variables if multicollinearity is present, or use dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Construction of the Regression Model Using the practice data, fit the multiple linear regression model. For this, you can utilize Python packages like scikit-learn or statsmodels. The model equation is going to look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "    wearing_off is equal to b0 plus b1 times heart rate, b2 times steps,... plus bn times timestamp_hour cos.\n",

        "6. Utilize the testing dataset to gauge the model's performance after it has been trained. Metrics like mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared are frequently used to measure the effectiveness of regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Analyzing the model: To comprehend the connection between each independent variable and the \"wearing_off\" result, examine the coefficients (b1, b2,..., bn). A positive correlation is implied by a positive coefficient, whereas a negative correlation is implied by a negative coefficient. Use p-values or confidence intervals to determine the statistical significance of the coefficients."
